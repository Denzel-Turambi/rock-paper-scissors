# Rock, Paper, Scissors 

### Abstract:
Do you ever need a quick break, but don't want to fully turn off your brain? Well, good news! This application will allow you (Link) to play a quick game of rock, paper, scissors against a computer (Ganondorf). The game follows the basic rules of rock, paper, scissors. However, if that is not challenging enough, the user can also select a difficult mode. In this mode, the user now has the option between five weapons instead of three,, making it much more difficult to claim victory over Ganondorf.

### Learning Goals:
Solidify and demonstrate my understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use my problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust myself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge
### Wins + Challenges:
Wins:
- CSS styling
- Learn new ways to write if statements
- Build my understanding of JS

Challenges:
- Writing the takeTurn function
- Working solo on a large project

I overcame these challenges by doing a lot of research and self-teaching, and reaching out to my rock and mentor for guidance.
